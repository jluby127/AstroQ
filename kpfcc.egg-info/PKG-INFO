# AstroQ
This software represents Version 2.0 of the KPF-CC autoscheduler, known as AstroQ.

This package contains the code for solving two related problems:
1. Optimal Semester Scheduler -- Determine which targets should be observed on which nights
2. Optimal Instrument Scheduler -- Determine the best distribution of nights for the KPF-CC queue in a semester

# Installation instructions

The installation of this package is not straight-forward. Please read carefully and follow closely.

We _*highly recommend*_ (though optional) setting up within a new Conda environment first. To do so, run this command and then be sure to activate the environment:
```
conda env create --name astroq --file <LOCAL PATH>/environment.yml
conda activate astroq
```

### Installing Gurobi
Before doing anything else, you must obtain a license for Gurobi.

`kpfcc` relies on Gurobi for solving large matrix equations efficiently. Follow these steps to install and set up Gurobi:

1. **Create an an Account** on Gurobi's [registration site](https://portal.gurobi.com/iam/register/). Select that you are an "Academic", type in your home institution, and submit the form via "Access Now". You will receive an email to complete the registration.
2. **Download Gurobi** for your OS from [this download page](https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/gurobi-software/). Run the installer file following their instructions.
3. **Request an Academic License** from your [user portal](https://portal.gurobi.com/iam/licenses/request/) *while connected to a university network*. You want the 'Named-User Academic License' which has a one year lifetime. At the end of the year, you can obtain a new license easily within your account (and for free) so long as you have maintained your academic status.
4. **Retrieve the License** by running the command from the popup window in a shell. It should look like:
```
grbgetkey 253e22f3...
```

(Add info on setting your environment variable to the correct license)

### Install AstroQ

Only once you have obtained a Gurobi license can clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/jluby127/astroq.git
```

And then install via:
```
pip install . (you may want include a "-e" flag if you intend to be editing the code)
```

This will set up the environment and all dependency packages. Once again, it is very important that you _**do not**_ run the pip installer until you have obtained a Gurobi license. I cannot stress this enough.

### Install ttpsolver
One of the optimalAllocation dependencies is a package we co-developed, the TTP Solver (Traveling Telescope Problem). While the AstroQ autoscheduler decides which requests should be observed on a given night, the TTP solves for the optimal slew path to observe all those targets within the night. This package is automatically installed via pip from the environment.yml; however, you must navigate to its local path update your environment variables. For more information on installation and documentation of the TTP, see its Github Repo at: https://github.com/lukehandley/ttp. 

# Run instructions

To test installation and practice the workflow of running the autoscheduler, use the supplied example. From your terminal, run the following command:
```
python <LOCAL_DIR>/bin/generate_night_plan.py -d 2024-08-02 -f <LOCAL_DIR>/examples/
```

## Flags

### Required

-f specifies the folder containing the inputs and outputs directory (can be defaulted to an environment variable: key name "KPFCC_SAVE_PATH")

-d specifies the date for which to produce a script, format YYYY-MM-DD (No Default)

### Advanced

-a specifies to run the autoscheduler (Default: True)

-p specifies to run the plotting/reporting suite (Default: True)

-ttp specifies to turn off the ttp solver (Default: False)

-r specifies to run the "bonus" round (Default: False)

-w specifies to turn off the weather loss simulations. Now no nights will be lost to weather. (Default: False)

### Optional

-s specifies the slot size, in minutes (Default: 5)

-b specifies to turn on the back up bright star list script. Now we will produce an additional night plan of only bright (V < 8) stars. (Default: False)

-t specifies the maximum time to solve the model (Default: 300s)

-g specifies to print the gorubi output to terminal (Default: True)
