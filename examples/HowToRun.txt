How to run the examples.

To recreate Figure 5 in the paper, run the following command.
1. cd to the top of the AstroQ directory
2. "python bin/run.py -d 2024-08-02 -c <your path>/AstroQ/examples/config_recreate_paper.ini"
3. This file is set up to run the "real_2024B_allocation" test. You can change to the "random allocation" or
    one of the optimal instrument allocation tests by editing the config file to the appropriate paths. And
    then changing the appropriate settings.
