Software for solving two related problems: 
1. Determine which targets should be observed on which nights (semester-solver)
2. Determine the best distribution of nights for the KPF-CC queue in a semester, given target request info

This software represents Version 2 of the KPF-CC algorithm, now with more granular scheduling of targets into individual slots within the semester. This new framework allows additional features as well.

Installation instructions: A number of packages are required to run this software, see the requirements.txt file.
